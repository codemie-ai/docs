# Integration

Integrations allow users to connect various external tools and services to expand assistants' capabilities. These integrations enable assistants to perform complex tasks such as creating pull requests in Git repositories, updating Jira issues, collecting information from news sites, and much more. Integrations can be configured at User, User Global, or Project levels to control availability and sharing across team members.

For detailed information about setting up and managing integrations, see the [Integrations Overview](../user-guide/concepts/integrations-overview).
