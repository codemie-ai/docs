# Data sources

Data sources serve to incorporate various types of data into the AI/Run CodeMie platform, expanding the range of tasks assistants can help with and enhancing their ability to provide relevant and accurate answers. Supported data source types include Git repositories, Confluence pages, Jira spaces, various file formats (PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.), and Google Docs. Data sources can be shared with project team members or kept private, and are indexed to enable assistants to access and search their content.

For detailed information about adding and managing data sources, see the [Data Source Overview](../user-guide/data-source/data-source-overview/).
