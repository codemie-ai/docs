# HTML Preview

Built-in HTML code preview functionality.

If you ask an AI/Run CodeMie assistant to generate HTML code, you might want to see a quick preview of the code. For this purpose, the HTML Preview function was added to AI/Run CodeMie. The distinguishing characteristic of this tool is that it is offered out of the box. You can quickly preview the resulting code by clicking the **Preview** button:

Once clicked, the **Preview HTML** window appears:

HTML Preview is available automatically for all assistants without requiring any integration setup. Simply ask your assistant to generate HTML code, and the Preview button will appear.

This feature allows you to instantly visualize HTML output without leaving the AI/Run CodeMie interface, making it convenient for rapid prototyping and testing.
